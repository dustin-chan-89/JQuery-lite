Hello!

This project, contained entirely in an IIFE, recreates most of the important functionality of the jQuery library. 

Most of the functionality is implemented using the native DOM api that is built right in to every browser. 

To test this library, download this repository and load up the sample index.html. It contains some divs and list items. You can play around with the library's functions on the DOM.
